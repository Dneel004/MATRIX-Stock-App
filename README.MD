Stock App

This app lets you see the stock information for the stock that you wish to choose.
This information includes the stocks name, price, change in price for the day, and change in percent for the day. You can look up any stock by typing in the stock SYMBOL (EX: Apple = AAPL) into the input area at the top where it says "Choose your stock". Once the app is started it will load the data for the stock indicated on the matrix by the spinning led loading sequence. Once a stock is loaded it will appear on the matrix dashboard and the matrix creator will light up either green (indicating the stock is positive) or red (indicating the stock is negative).
